# Random Cut Forest CLI

Command-line interface for [Random Cut Forest](https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws) anomaly detection

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/rcf-cli/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ankane/rcf-cli/actions)

## Installation

Download the latest version:

- Linux - [x86_64]() or [arm64]()
- Mac - [x86_64]() or [arm64]()
- Windows - [x86_64]()

You can also install it with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install ankane/brew/rcf
```

## Getting Started

Prepare a CSV. Each row should be a data point. Hereâ€™s [an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankane/rcf-cli/master/example-data/input.csv) with three dimensions:

```text
$ tail input.csv
5.0001,0.0006,-0.0084
-4.9998,0.0041,0.0025
-5.0096,-0.0085,-0.0007
4.9980,-0.0049,-0.0029
5.0083,0.0078,-0.0029
0.0001,-0.0052,0.0003
5.0051,0.0081,-0.0068
5.0044,-0.0030,-0.0016
-5.0028,-0.0067,-0.0056
4.9921,0.0092,0.0049
```

And run:

```sh
rcf < input.csv > output.csv
```

The program outputs the anomaly score as a new column. Anomalous data points are given a larger score.

```text
$ tail output.csv
5.0001,0.0006,-0.0084,0.7980522827802555
-4.9998,0.0041,0.0025,0.7071138288972222
